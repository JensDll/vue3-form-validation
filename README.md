#  Form Validation for Vue 3

**🚨 NOTICE: This project has been moved and will be further maintained at https://github.com/JensDll/validierung**

With mostly the same API, the new version will support Vue 2 and 3 (integration using [vue-demi](https://github.com/vueuse/vue-demi)). Below are the few breaking changes:
- The interface `CustomValidationBehaviorFunctions` was renamed to `ValidationBehaviorFunctions`.
- The `$rawErrors` property was removed from transformed fields.

I believe the new version works well now, and I'll be considerate when adding new features moving forward.
